This project is a demo webapp of a few cold-start recommendation algorithms for mobile apps.

In order to see the webapp, please clone the repository, navigate to the "deloitte/" folder in your terminal, and run the "python manage.py runserver" command. Then you can open the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/" URL in your browser in order to render the web interface.
